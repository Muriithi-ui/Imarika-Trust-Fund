                <p className='text-xl'>Imarika helps you ensure the proper management of your property and
assets in accordance with your wishes, in the unfortunate event of your incapacitation or demise. It’s important
to note that you can have a trust set up to run whilst you are alive. This is especially important if you want to
have a say in the critical aspects of your loved ones’ lives such as education, medical care and general well-being 
and upkeep when you are gone. We acknowledge that it is important to you to ensure that your legacy lives on and the 
Imarika Trust Fund enables you to do just that!</p></div>
<div className='p-8 pt-10 m-12 shadow-2xl'>
                <p>Upon your demise, your Trust becomes
“irrevocable” which means that all the wishes you had narrated cannot be changed. From then on, your funds, 
property and assets are managed and distributed by the Imarika Trust Fund (Trustees) in accordance with your instructions 
throughout the rest of the Trust’s existence.</p>
